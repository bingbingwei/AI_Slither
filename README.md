# AI_Slither
## Brief
The final project of Prof. YJ Hsu's Artificial Intelligence course.
It's about implement an Artificial Itelligent Agent which plays the famous game-Slither. We tried different methods including several kinds of algorithm and Reinforcement Deep Learning trained model.

## Technique
* modified BFS, DFS, A* algorithms
* Study of Approximate Algorithm that tries to solve Hamiltonian Cycle
* **Reinforcement Deep Learning** model using **Pytorch**

## Result
The RDL trained agent can get average scroe of about 24 points over 8*8 map.
